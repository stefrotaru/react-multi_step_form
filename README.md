Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3, CSS Grid, Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - React state management tool
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### Redux Store Slices

- The Redux store slices are defined as follows:
```
{
  stepsProgress?: {
    userInfo: false,
    selectPlan: false,
    selectAddons: false,
    summary: false,
  },
  user: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
  },
  plan: {
    subscriptionType: '',
    subscriptionPrice: '',
    subscriptionRenewalInterval: '',
    subscriptionRenewalIntervalUnit: '', (Monthly || Yearly)
  },
  addons: [
    {
      addonName: '',
      addonPrice: '',
      addonRenewalInterval: '', (Monthly || Yearly)
    },
    {
      ...
    },
  ],
  formTotalPrice: {
    totalPrice: 0,
  }
}
```

### Project goals

With this Front End Mentor challenge I have refreshed my React/Redux knowledge.
My goals with this project were to:
- capture the form fields values into a Redux store, composed of multiple slices, each slice with it's own scope;
- build a efficient SPA;
- consume json data;
- use as few external libraries as possible;
- practice the BEM methodology wits Scss;
